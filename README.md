## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Sakshi, a 19-year-old learner on a mission ðŸš€

Iâ€™m exploring the world of development with **fierce enthusiasm** and a hunger to create **soulful ideas** that matter.

ðŸ’¡ About me

I believe every idea has a heartbeat, and I love giving mine to soulful ones.

No projects yet, but every line I write is a brick toward something meaningful.

Iâ€™m driven, curious, and excited to connect with fellow learners & builders.
